# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help secure this project.  
We take security **very seriously** and appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or potential risk, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, contact us directly at: **security@ataides.com**

Include the following in your message:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation (if known)
- Your contact information (for coordinated disclosure)

We aim to respond within **5 business days**, but usually it's faster than that.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- Terraform modules in this repository (`/modules/`)
- Compliance controls or metadata (`/compliance/`, `metadata.yaml`)
- CI/CD workflows that affect build or release integrity
- Documentation if it misleads users into insecure usage

Out of scope:

- Issues with cloud provider APIs or third-party modules we do not own
- Deprecated or explicitly marked experimental modules

## Disclosure Process

1. We acknowledge receipt of your report.
2. We investigate and verify the issue.
3. We work on a fix and test it thoroughly.
4. We coordinate a public disclosure (if appropriate).
5. You are credited (unless anonymity is requested).

## Thank You

We value responsible security research and thank you for helping us build a safer cloud infrastructure ecosystem.
